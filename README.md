Dabbling with face recognition / landmarks detection in the browser.

This is a service worker impelementation relying on `face-api.js`. I'm achieving roughly 50 fps on my Macbook Pro.

A more promising approach using tensorflow.js directly, is documented [here](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/11/iris-landmark-tracking-in-browser-with-MediaPipe-and-TensorFlowJS.html).
